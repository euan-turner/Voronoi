Site Event - 
Sweepline passes a new site. A new parabola is added to the beach line.
Two edges begin at the intersections of the new parabola, and the neighbours.
These "half-edges" are associated with both parabolas forming them.

Circle/Edge-Intersection Event - 
A parabola in the beach line disappears as it is squeezed out by its neighbours. 
This occurs when two neighbouring "half-edges", on either side of the parabola, intersect.
The point of occurrence is equidistant to the focii of the three parabolas, so becomes a Voronoi vertex.
The y-coord of the sweep line when a circle event occurs is given by:
    y-coord of intersection point - distance between focus of any involved arcs and the intersection point
This circle event can then be added to the event queue, but may be removed if invalidated by subsequent changes to the beach line.
This point becomes the end point for both half-edges associated with the disappearing parabola.


The beachline only changes at site or circle events.


for each point
    push a site event to event queue

while event queue is not empty
    pop the top event
    if event is a site event
        insert new parabola in beach line
        check for new circle events
        if new circle events exist
            push circle event to event queue
    else -> event is a circle event
        create a voronoi vertex
        remove squeezed parabola from beach line
        delete invalidated events
        check for new circle events
        if new circle events exist
            push circle event to queue
