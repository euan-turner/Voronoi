## Voronoi
Various algorithms for creating a Voronoi diagram from a set of points in ***Python***.

A Voronoi diagram takes a set **S** of *n* points as input. For *n* âˆˆ **S**, the diagram contains a polygon, such that *n* is the closest point in **S** to any point in the polygon.

# Libraries
* shapely
* matplotlib
* random
* dataclasses
* pygame

# Pixels
Extremely slow method of checking each individual location

# Iterative Addition
Incrementally adding points, and updating the regions of existing points, until the entire set has been exhausted.
Time: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
